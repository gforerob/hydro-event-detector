NFFAS (Numerical Flash Flood Alert Solutions) is an interactive web-based platform designed to detect, visualize, calculate the volume and enable the download of significant hydrological events, including volume, date and flow data at the start, peak and end of each event, for more than 4,000 USGS stations, covering the period from April 2019 to March 2025. Processing is performed on the web using the Python package HydroEventDetector, enabling fast, reproducible, and scalable analysis while facilitating user interaction.  To use the tool, select a state from the "Select a State" field. The colored points displayed on the map represent a flashiness classification based on the number of detected peaks. Click on a colored point, then click the "Show Chart" button. Next, choose the desired percentile and date range, and click "Refresh Plot." To download the results, click the "Download CSV" button.
